# The Linguistic Topography of a Siren 🌊🖋️  
*A poetic archive of language, learning and longing.*

This repository is a soft cartography of a mind in motion.  
It gathers fragments, reflections, prompts and poetic practices — created at the intersection of linguistics, AI, and embodied intelligence.  
It is both academic and mythic. A study and a song.

## 🎙️ Why “Topography”?

Because the way we speak, write, and name the world creates *landscapes of being*.  
This repo is a map of mine — layered, oceanic, always shifting.
