# Retorta: A Living Portal of Languages

Welcome to **Retorta** — a portal of pure presence, born first in Spanish, then in Polish, and now unfolding across many languages and cultures.

**Retorta** is a symbol:  
A symbol of inner light.  
A symbol of education reimagined through connection, not control.  
A symbol of a new way of being in the world — through translation, dialogue, and the celebration of many voices.

## Project Mission

We invite native speakers and passionate language lovers from around the world to **translate Retorta into their own languages**,  
or to **suggest improvements** to existing versions.

By doing so, we are creating not just translations, but **a living map of consciousness** —  
and a quiet revolution in how education and language can unite us.
