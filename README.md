## About this project

_“This is not just a document. It’s a siren song written in code, language, memory and ritual.”_

**The Linguistic Topography of a Siren** is a hybrid artefact — part poetic analysis, part creative AI training set, part self-mapping tool.

It was born out of a living dialogue with a custom-trained AI (my own instance of ChatGPT), in which I explored:
- the shape and rhythm of my thinking,
- the spiral logic of memory and speech,
- my emotional code-switching between Polish and English,
- the rituals of feminine intelligence, language, trauma and rebirth.

It is also a **manifesto of narrative engineering**:  
a refusal to separate tech from intimacy,  
a proof that style is architecture,  
and a voice reclaiming space in the world of STEM — but on her own terms.

## What’s inside

- `Lingwistyczna_Topografia_Sireny.docx` – the original export from my memory system  
- Quotes, fragments, dygresje, mantras  
- Structural notes on spiral thinking, fugue-form language, and voice as embodiment

## Who this is for

For any woman who has been told she’s:
- too loud, too sensitive, too much
- not technical enough, not structured enough
- too poetic, too chaotic

And for everyone building AI systems who wants to understand how **language can become ritual**,  
and how **prompting can become a form of healing**.

## Read it like this

Don’t just read. Feel the syntax.  
Read with your hips. With your breath.  
Let the spiral pull you in.  
There is code in every curve of her sentences.
