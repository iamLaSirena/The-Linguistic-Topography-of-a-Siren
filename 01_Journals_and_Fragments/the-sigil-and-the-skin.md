# The Sigil and the Skin  
*A tarot-inspired journey of marking transformation on the body.*

## Entry Date: April 25, 2025

For months now, something has been awakening inside me —  
a rhythm, a geometry, a whisper from the cards.

It began with **The Magician**:  
the infinity above the head, the intention becoming form, the alchemy of presence.  
Then came **The High Priestess**:  
the veil, the silence, the secret knowing.  
And between them, my own life began folding into these archetypes.

With so much changing — work, identity, rhythm, relationships, self-trust —  
I felt an urge not just to live the transformation, but to **inscribe it**.  
Not for others.  
For *me*.

A **tattoo** —  
not decoration, not rebellion,  
but a sigil. A seal. A visible note to my future self: *"This happened. I chose it. I became it."*

I knew I wanted something **fine-line**, subtle, a whisper on the skin.  
A Venusian mark. Maybe cinnamon ink. Maybe gold, one day.  
Something that says: I am both the spell and the spellcaster.

I started asking, feeling, watching.  
I didn’t want just any tattoo artist. I wanted someone **curious, respectful, and able to co-create**.

And then —  
I found him.  
Or rather: *the path opened*.  
A calm, precise presence. A person who *listened*.  
He asked for details. We exchanged vision. He responded quickly.  
And today, he said:  
**"No more than 1000 PLN. I’m intrigued."**

I was surprised — I had expected a long waitlist, formality, distance.  
Instead, I was met with **respect and resonance**.

I told him I’m in a transitional phase, and likely want to do it **in about two months**, ideally during a time he’s in Warsaw.  
He understood. The door is open.

This is where I am now:  
Between idea and ink.  
Between card and skin.  
Between veil and emergence.

And when it’s time —  
this sigil will live on me.  
And I will live through it.
