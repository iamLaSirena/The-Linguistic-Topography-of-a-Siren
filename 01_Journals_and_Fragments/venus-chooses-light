# Venus Chooses Light  
*Perfume as a ritual of radiance, selected in tune with transits.*

## Entry Date: April 25, 2025

Sometimes perfume isn't just scent.  
It's an **invocation. A mood. A magnetic field.**  
A Venus moment captured in molecules.

In the days following a powerful astrological shift —  
with Venus moving gently through Scorpio while Jupiter watched from Taurus —  
I stood between perfumes,  
listening to what my skin, my orbit, and my feminine energy needed.

I chose two:

### 1. **Roberto Cavalli (Original EDP)**  
Golden, sultry, luminous.  
Like walking into a room and knowing you're the center of gravity.  
It wraps around the body like a velvet flame —  
sweet orange blossom, tonka, a trace of amber.  
This is perfume as **sovereignty**.

### 2. **Huile Prodigieuse NUXE Florale**  
The floral oil of soft power.  
Neroli, grapefruit, a whisper of magnolia.  
This isn’t perfume, it’s **skin light**.  
I use it on collarbones, wrists, thighs —  
as if **anointing myself with softness and presence.**  
It leaves a rose-gold sheen that catches light like a secret.

Together, they became my **daily Venus ritual**:  
- One for stepping into the world with magnetism.  
- One for staying in the body like a sanctuary.

I didn’t choose with logic.  
I chose with my chart.  
With desire.  
With the subtle *yes* that lives in scent.

*Sometimes, beauty is not what you wear.  
It’s what wears you — softly, confidently, like light on skin.*
