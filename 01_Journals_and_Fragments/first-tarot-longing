# First Tarot Longing  
*A contemplation on choosing my first deck — between symbol, fire, and sensuality.*

## Entry Date: April 25, 2025

I’m circling the idea of buying my first personal tarot deck.  
Not as a trend, not as decor —  
but as a **portal** to inspiration, archetypes, memory, and metamorphosis.

Tarot speaks to me the way poetry does:  
through symbol, texture, gesture.  
Each card feels like a mirror from a parallel life.

Lately I’ve been exploring different designs —  
noticing how much **visual language matters** to me.  
It’s not just about clarity.  
It’s about *invocation*.

Some decks — like **The Marigold Tarot**, which is popular with Gen Z — are beautiful, but feel a bit too clean, too skeletal for me.  
I admire it, but it doesn’t stir my inner world.

As a **millennial**, and a **Plutonic woman** — born of **magma, fire, and sacred soil** — I find myself magnetized by more symbolic, surreal, and sensuous decks.

These two keep calling me back:

### 1. **Fyodor Pavlov Tarot**  
Illustrated like a baroque folktale whispered in candlelight.  
Queer, lush, deeply human.  
Cards that look like they’ve lived through something.

### 2. **Dreamkeepers Tarot**  
Otherworldly and intimate.  
Faces blurred into clouds, time stretching like silk.  
This deck feels like reading oracles in a dream you once had but forgot.

A third contender:  
### 3. **The Moonchild Tarot**  
Elegant, sacred, and lunar —  
a ritual tool more than a storytelling device.  
It speaks in light codes, not drama.

For now, I’m holding the decision.  
This is a sacred choice —  
like choosing a voice that will echo through my days and rituals.  
But I feel the moment is near.

When I do choose,  
I want to mark it here:  
**the first mirror I invite into my hands.**
