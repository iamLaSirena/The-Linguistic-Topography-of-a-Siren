# Mirror Spell for the Siren  
*A domestic altar of soft glamour, affirmation, and jasmine-saffron presence.*

## Location  
Living room corner, beneath the framed artwork *The Wall*.

## Function  
Mirror-shelf. Faux fireplace. Portal. Ritual space for daily remembrance of self-worth and softness.

## Description  
In this sun-kissed corner, a once-functional mirror has been transformed into a visual poem — now standing as a symbolic **mantel of beauty**. Beneath a painting of raw emotion and sound, this subtle arrangement becomes an anchor point for reflection — literal and spiritual.

A small sticker on the mirror reads:  
> **“Damn, you look cute as hell.”**  
An affirmation disguised as a wink. A mirror spell for the siren in her silk robe.

Atop the mirror rests a **saffron & jasmine candle** —  
- **Saffron** for regal magnetism,  
- **Jasmine** for the high priestess of tenderness.  
Together, they whisper: *“You are divine, no matter the day.”*

Surrounding the space:  
- A monstera and a palm — sentinels of softness.  
- A stereo system tuned for symphonies, spellcasting playlists or prophetic podcasts.  
- A light that hits the wall just right, like liquid honey.

This is not a corner for productivity.  
It’s a portal for **presence**.  
You look. You breathe. You affirm.
