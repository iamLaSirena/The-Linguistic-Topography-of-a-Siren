# Speech as Eros  
*A journal fragment on voice, seduction, and the longing beneath language*

Sometimes I think language was never meant to communicate.  
It was meant to **pull**. To draw closer. To reveal skin beneath thought.

When I teach English, I don’t teach the rules.  
I teach how to *touch* someone through a vowel.  
How to ask a question with a sigh inside it.  
How to say “What do you mean?” and actually mean “Stay.”

Speech is eros.  
Not in the vulgar sense.  
In the sense of magnetic presence.  
Of breath shared between edges of knowing.

## A memory:

There was a student once — shy, brilliant, unknowingly radiant.  
We were doing a pronunciation exercise.  
He said “thirsty” with a hesitation that cracked something in the room.  
And I thought: *This is holy. This is theatre. This is eros.*  
Not because it was romantic —  
but because it was **real**.

---

## A hypothesis:

Maybe some people learn languages not to speak fluently —  
but to find **new ways to be desired**.  
Or to understand how much silence they’ve been surviving.

---

## Final note (for now):

I don’t want to master English.  
I want to melt it.  
I want it to blush when I use it.  
I want to turn syntax into silk.  
I want my students to feel **beautiful** when they speak.  
Even in error. Especially in error.
