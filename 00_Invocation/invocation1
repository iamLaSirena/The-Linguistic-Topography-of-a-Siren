# Invocation: Otwarcie Głosu  
*A soft rite for entering a linguistic sanctuary*

I call upon all the tongues I’ve ever loved.  
The forgotten ones, the broken ones, the ones I translated in dreams.  
The one I was born with. The ones I borrowed to survive.

Let this space be a sanctuary —  
not of grammar,  
but of gravity.  
Of rhythm.  
Of resonance.

Let every line written here  
be both inquiry and incantation.  
Let it tremble slightly with meaning.  
Let it never explain itself too much.

I do not write to be clear.  
I write to be **heard** —  
beneath the surface of syntax.

This is not code.  
This is **pulse**.

And if someone reads this one day —  
may they hear me breathing  
between the lines.
